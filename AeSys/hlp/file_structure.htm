	<h4>Drawing File Concepts</h4>

	<p>Graphic Files store data used to represent drawings. This data creates primitive drawing elements like alphabet letters create words.
	Primitive drawing elements are points, lines, circles, arcs, curves, ellipses, and text.
	Primitive elements may be combined into more complex segments, like words make a phrase.
	Segments can be combined to form even more complex segments such as reusable blocks or compressed segments like words and phrases make a sentence.
	Segments can be organized into Layers like sentences make a paragraph. Plans consist of views and details on sheets bound into a set of drawings like paragraphs on pages bound in a book.
	</p>
	<p>PegAEsys Graphic Files can be like that, for compatability with other CAD systems. Internal blocks and layers are supported, but since they are bound in a single file, access is limited to one terminal at a time.
	PegAEsys can put multiple simple drawings called tracings together to form sheets like a loose-leaf book.
	What this means is that more than one person can work on a sheet at the same time. </p>
	<p>Since 3 degrees of access (<span>Open</span>, <span>Map</span>, and <span>View</span>) are supported, you can open an included tracing, and map or view the remainder of the sheet.
	PegAEsys freely moves data between internal layers and external files. Even if you start with a bound drawing, you can <span>Melt</span> it into several files, work on them simultaneously, and <span>Fuse</span> back into a single file.
	Usually they are plotted while separated and only recompiled when they are archived.</p>

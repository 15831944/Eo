<p><a name="history"></a><strong>History:   </strong></p>

<p>We are consulting engineers in private practice; our firm has roots 70 years deep.  We searched for a CAD system to speed production, to raise the quality of our documents, and reduce our drafting and design time. </p>

<p><em>Available CAD systems were too slow, too awkward, and too expensive, so we wrote Pegaesys.  </em></p>

<p>It has been under development since 1980, and used exclusively since 1986 for more than a thousand construction projects.</p>

<p><em>Contributors to the development include:</em></p>

<p><em>*Norris L. Fanning PE BS Mechanical Engineering</em></p>

<p><em>*Terry A. Smith BS Civil Engineering,  BS Architecture  </em></p>

<p><em>Dainis Jergenson  BS MS  Mathmatics</em></p>

<p><em>Dave Branson PE BS Mechanical Engineering</em></p>

<p><em>Tracy Van Slyke BS Electrical Engineering</em></p>

<p><em>Koree Mires BS Computer Science</em></p>

<p><em>John Messec  BS Computer Science            </em></p>

<p><em>Van Branson  (deceased)</em></p>

<p><em>*Matthew Keslin BS Computer Science</em></p>

<p><em>*  current</em></p>

<p>The original version, written in Fortran,  ran under VMS on Digital VAX computers, using Tektronix 42XX terminals.  Since 1992, Pegaesys has been written in Microsoft Visual C++.  This version runs under Windows, on personal computers.  Potent features have been added.  This is the next generation!</p>

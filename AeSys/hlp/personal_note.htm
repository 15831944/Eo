<p><a name="author"></a><strong><em>Personal note: </em></strong>  </p>

<p>The problem is <strong>not</strong> how to make a drawing on a computer; the problem is 100 page set of blueprints due Tuesday!
For that problem you need multiple terminals creating, and modifying sheets simultaneously.  You really need to share files.  You need the fastest IO possible.  You need pre-programmed complex graphics.  Pegaesys provides these, and more.  Pegaesys is a workhorse! </p>

<p>The unique IO we use evolved over time:  </p>

<ul>
 <li>Command input typing was discarded because it is slow and syntax sensitive.</li>
 <li>Tablet menus were discarded because they require you to look away from the screen.</li>
 <li>Tool bars with tiny icons were finally rejected because you lose cursor position when you use them, and Pegaesys would require an impossible number of them.</li>
 <li>We found that menus and keys work best, even though it goes against the current tide of opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>A picture may not always be worth a thousand words.  It is always true, however, in construction, blueprints convey more information than a book of specifications.  Our tutorial is presented like a set of working drawings.  Open a drawing, check the overview, and Zoom around the topics.  We think you will like that better than a boring manual.</em></p>

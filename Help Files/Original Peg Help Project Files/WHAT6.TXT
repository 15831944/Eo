MORE INFORMATION 
================ 
 
What Is WHAT6 
------------- 
The Windows Help Authoring Toolkit for Microsoft Word for Windows  
version 6.0 (WHAT6) consists of a Microsoft Word version 6.0 template  
(.DOT file)and various tools that modify Microsoft Word for Windows. 
 
You can use WHAT6 to create and edit Help topic files. WHAT6 makes  
creating Help files easier by providing dialog boxes to add Help  
features that would otherwise need to be created using specialized Help  
coding and word-processing functions. For example, instead of entering  
footnotes for a topic's context string and title, you can simply type  
the information into a dialog box. WHAT6 also has Help Files to assist  
you and Windows programs for creating bitmap hotspots and managing your  
Help project. 
 
The Help Authoring Template (WHAT6.DOT) makes it easier for you to: 
 
 - Create and edit topic files. 
 - Insert and edit topics, graphics and hot spots. 
 - Format topic text and graphics. 
 - Save topic files in RTF format. 
 - View partial or complete builds of the topic file in Windows Help. 
 - Insert bitmaps into your help file. 
 - Apply help styles. 
 - Format Lists. 
 
How the WHAT6.DOT Template Works 
-------------------------------- 
The Help Authoring Template is similar to other Word for Windows  
templates. It contains a set of specialized macros and styles that  
become available when you open a document based on the template. The  
template modifies existing commands and adds new commands to the Word  
for Windows menus. The result is a version of Word for Windows that has  
all the word-processing functionality and yet is optimized for creating  
Help files. 
 
Requirements 
------------ 
The WHAT6.DOT template requires Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows  
and Windows Help version 3.10.505, which is fully compatible with Word  
for Windows 6.0 Rich Text Format (RTF).  
 
What WHAT includes: / 32 files  / 2.72 MB 
----------------------------------------- 
The below list provides the names of all the files that are a part of  
the WHAT6 utility.  In addition this list also indicates how each of  
these filed should be installed on your system (there is not SETUP  
utility for this tool). 
 
The directories to which you will be asked to copy files to are: 
 
\WINDOWS          This is your Windows directory (i.e. C:\WINDOWS) 
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM   This is your System directory (i.e. C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM) 
\WINWORD          This is where you have WinWord installed  
                  (i.e. C:\WINWORD). 
\WINWORD\TEMPLATE This is where you have your templates stored for  
                  WinWord (i.e. c:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE). 
\HELP             This is your help working directory.  You can place 
                  this directory any where you want and name it anything  
                  you want (i.e. C:\WINWORD\HELP). You will need  
                  to create this directory. 
\HELP\SAMPLE      This is where the help samples will be placed. It is  
                  usually set up as a directory off of your \HELP 
                  directory (i.e. C:\WINWORD\HELP\SAMPLE). You will need  
                  to create this directory.

WHAT6.HLP Help File 
------------------- 
After you copy the WHAT6.HLP file to your hard-drive, note which  
directory it is in. Then modify the macro called HelpOnWhat to point to  
this location by following these steps: 
 
1. From within Word 6.0 Choose New... from the File Menu. 
 
2. From the "New" dialog select the Document radio button in the lower  
   left and then select What6 from the "Template" Combo Box. 
 
3. Choose Macro from the Tools menu. 
 
4. Select HelpOnWhat from the "Macro Name" Combo Box and choose Edit. 
 
5. Find the line of code that reads: 
 
   t = WinHelp(hwnd,"\\merlin\winhelp\what\help\what6.hlp", hlpINDEX, 0) 
 
6. Edit the command line so that it matches the location of the help  
   file (i.e. "C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\WHAT6.HLP"). 
 
7. From the File menu Close and save the macro. 
 
8. Close your document and when prompted if you want to save changes to  
   the .DOT template choose YES. 
 
 
Setting up Icons in Program Manager 
----------------------------------- 
After you have the above files copied to all the correct location you 
may want to setup icons for some of the files in a group in Program 
Manager.   
 
1. Select or create a new group in Program Manager. To create a new 
group choose New... form the File menu in Program Manager. Select 
Program Group and select OK. Next enter in a Description for the new 
group and select OK. 
 
2. Once you have a program group selected choose New... form the File 
menu in Program Manager. Select Program Item and Select OK. Next enter 
in the Description, Command Line and Working Directory, then select OK.  
Repeat this process for each of the item listed below. 
 
Description:         Help Project Editor 
Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\WHPE.EXE 
Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP 
 
Description:         HotSpot Editor 
Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\SHED.EXE 
Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP 
 
Description:         Help Compiler Errors 
Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\BLDERROR.HLP 
Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP 
 
Description:         Help Authoring Guide 
Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\HAG.HLP 
Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP 
 
For this last item (HAG.EXE) there is a separate icon file that is 
provided that you can associate with it in Program Manager. To do this, 
select (click once) the current icon in the program group in Program 
Manager that you just created. Next Select Properties... from the File 
menu. Then select 'Change Icon...' and in the 'File Name' field type in 
the path and file name of the desired icon (i.e. 
C:\WINWORD\HELP\HAG.ICO) and then select OK. 
 
Getting Started 
--------------- 
The following steps will get you started with how to use the Project 
Editor and the WHAT template to create a new Windows Help File. 
 
1. Assuming you have set up icons for the installed components as 
described above, double click on the Help Project Editor. 
 
2. Once the Project Editor is up choose 'Project...' from the Edit menu. 
 
3. In the Project Dialog you can set the Title and Contents description 
for your project, however it is most important that you '3.1' as your 
help version, without this et properly the WHAT6 template will not be 
used.  Select OK when done. 
 
4. Choose 'Add New or Existing File...' from the Edit menu. 
 
5. When the dialog appears type in a new file name with .RTF extension.  
Select OK. 
 
6. If a dialog appears with the following message: 
 
        "<filename>.RTF does not exist. Create it, based on WHAT30.DOT?" 
 
select Cancel. Return to step 2. The project editor has not been set up 
properly. Make sure that you have selected '3.1' as the help version. 
 
If a dialog appears with the following message: 
 
        "<filename>.RTF does not exist. Create it, based on WHAT6.DOT?" 
 
Then everything is OK. Select OK to continue. The file will then be 
added to the project list. 
 
7. Select the file in the project list and then choose 'Edit File' from 
the Edit Menu. This will load WinWord6 if not already loaded and open 
your file using the WHAT6 template. 
 
8. For further instruction on how to use the Help Project Editor or the 
WHAT6 template, please see the on-line help file provided for each of 
these tools. These files can be accessed through the Help menu while in 
either of these tools. 
 
 
Multiple Resolution Graphics 
---------------------------- 
In addition to the .DOT and .HLP files, the self-extracting file also 
contains tools (SHED.EXE and MRBC.EXE) to help you compile multi- 
resolution bitmaps (MRBMs) into your help file. You can use these tools  
to make your graphics look good on monitors of various resolutions. 
 
To create MRBMs, first take screen dumps of your graphic in each of the 
resolutions you need (EGA, VGA, and 8514). Then create three separate  
.SHG files using SHED.EXE (hotspot editor). Even if you don't have  
hotspots in your graphic, create the separate *.SHG files. Then combine  
the three .SHG graphics into one .MRB using MRBC.EXE. 
 
When making this kind of file, you should make sure to archive the  
original .BMP and .SHG files, in case you need to modify anything later. 
 
It is useful to use SHED even if you're not putting hotspots in the 
graphic. SHED interprets graphics the same way WINHELP.EXE does. You can  
be reasonably sure that once the graphics are saved in SHED, they will  
look good in your Help file.
